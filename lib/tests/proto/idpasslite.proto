  // address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the
  // address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
  // used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and

  // of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
  // address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
  // approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be
  // made about any of the address components until it was at least
  // partially resolved.
  //
